Things never to do again:  
Do not under any circumstance use SELECT DISTINCT to return unique results from a database because a subquery or join is causing duplicate rows. Â You are getting duplicate rows because the subquery or join isn't as accurate as it needs to be... stop using this as a quick fix it only causes bigger pains later.
