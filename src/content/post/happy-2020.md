Wishing everyone a Happy New Decade.  As with [arrays](https://xkcd.com/163/), there are camps on the 0 or 1 starting point.  I'll continue being annoyed with Anno Domini one zero-based milestone at a time.  Let this discrepancy serve as a reminder to never deal with dates and times without the aid of a library, because you too are [probably wrong about time](https://gist.github.com/timvisee/fcda9bbdff88d45cc9061606b4b923ca).  
  
The end of 2019 ended up absurdly crunched and I haven't had much opportunity for memory lane.  I've made a new year's resolution to blog more, and finishing that list is my first stop.
